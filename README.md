# Smal.me
A simple link shortening site. Just posting for portfolio reasons, if you want to use this you have to change directories and create the password file and such. Requires SQL. This site is my first go at PHP, so hopefully there is no massive gamebreaking security flaw in there somewhere. :p

KEEP IN MIND that I didn't really take the time to organize or structure this properly because it is kind of a throwaway. Just wanted to give PHP a go by making a website in a day.
